# MOBILE-ROBOT-NAVIGATION-IN-AN-INDOOR-ENVIRONMENT
Developed a cost-effective mobile robot with 16 ultrasonic sensors, IMU for 360-degree obstacle detection and precise localization. Implemented sensor fusion with Kalman filter, Bluetooth communication, and a control algorithm for autonomous navigation. Created a real-time visualization system using Python and Turtle graphics.

For convenience, this project is split into 2 phases: Phase - 1 and Phase - 2.
Phase - 1 discusses the development of mapping and localization of mobile robots using IMU sensors.
Phase - 2 discusses the integration of 16 ultrasonic sensors with the IMU sensor to enhance the mapping and obstacle detection of the mobile robot.
