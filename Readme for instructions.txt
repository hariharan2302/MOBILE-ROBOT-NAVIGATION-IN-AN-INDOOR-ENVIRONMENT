Steps to start the project:

1. Install the CH34X driver in the PC (file name: CH34x_Install_Windows_v3_4)
2. Connect a type B USB cable between arduino mega and PC.
3. Dump the arduino code in mega. (file name: final_wireless_code_16_sensor_copy)
4. Disconnect the connection from PC.
(Note: The "wheel code" can be dumped into motor shield by disconnecting bluetooth module and after dumping the code, reconnect the bluetooth module)
5. Connect 5V battery for arduino mega and motor shield.
6. Download "Bluetooth RC Controller" from the app store and Make the wireless connection between the bluetooth module and the phone.
7. Switch on the 12 V battery connection for motor power supply.
8. Download Pycharm and run the python code (file name: visualization of 16 sensor (wireless code))
9. There you go!! Now run the robot using the RC controller and check the output of python code. Before running the program, make sure to install the necessary librarires in the Pycharm.
